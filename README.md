A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that counts footnotes & Pandoc citations. It also indicates their presence in the gutter.

That's it, that's the plugin.

## Limitations
- As Obsidian does not assign a css-class to *inline* footnotes, they can't be indicated in the gutter. (However, they are counted properly in the status bar.)

## Installation
The plugin is available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` â†’ `Community Plugins` â†’ `Browse` â†’ Search for *"Footnote & Citation Indicator"*

## Contribute
Please use the `.eslintrc` configuration located in the repository and run eslint before doing a pull request, and please do *not* use `prettier`. ðŸ™‚

```shell
# Run eslint fixing most common mistakes
eslint --fix *.ts
```
